      <h2>While we were dating</h2>
      <p> This is an interesting story. I used to live by my husband’s aunt and uncle. I have known them since I was in 3rd grade. It all started Adam and me with AOL instant message. That was online dating before online dating was popular. My mom
        and I used to sit down at the computer together and talk to people. That was her way of ensuring that I was safe while I was talking to people online. Adam and I went on our first date to Austin Powers the Spy Who Shagged Me. After the movie,
        he brought me home. I honestly wasn't sure if he liked me or not but then once he got home he instant messaged me and asked if I would like to go on
        another date the next day. We met on my birthday in 1999. Yes, that is right over 18 years ago. </p>

      <h2 id="wedding"> Our wedding </h2>

      <p>We got married on October 16, 2004. It was a cold fall day, and it was super windy. I remember being so excited and yet so nervous because anyone who truly knows me knows just how much of a klutz I am. I was so worried I was going to pass
        out or trip on my dress. Lol, I actually did my dad accidentally stepped on my dress when he was walking me down the aisle. However, the funniest and most embarrassing thing that happened the day of our wedding was that I forgot the wedding
        ring. Oops. Lol, good thing my grandpa and Adam’s hands were close to the same size because for the ceremony we had to use my grandpa’s ring, because I realized it too late. </p>

      <p> We had a total of three bridesmaids and groomsmen. We had my best friend as my maid-of-honor, and my sister and my sister-in-law were bridesmaids. We had his brother as best man, his friend and cousin were grooms-men. It was so cute because
        when his cousin was walking down the aisle his little nephew screamed out his name. It still makes me laugh out loud when I think about that, and how cute that was. </p>

      <h2 id="after"> Life after the wedding </h2>
      <p> My husband and I had our 13-year anniversary this past October. We have been through a lot in our life together so far, but I would not want to be spending the good, the bad, and the ugly with anyone else. I love him so much. </p>



      <h2 id="furbabies"> Fur babies </h2>

      <p> Adam and I have three fur babies. I said fur babies, not Furby’s. We have three cat’s Cyrus, Skiddy, and Perseus. Just like kids let me tell you, they all have their own personalities, and their own ways to be naughty. </p>

      <h3 id="cyrus">Cyrus</h3>

      <p> Cyrus is the cat we have had the longest. He is a gray, tan, and black American Short hair as you can see in the picture. We got him at a very young age, probably too young. We got him from our local pet store. He found me I guess I should
        say.
        It was funny because when we brought him home the store gave us a brown box to carry him in. The little squirt (at the time. He’s not so little anymore.) Got out of his box and decided to crawl all over the car. He was so cute trying to crawl
        up our bed to get to us. He has always liked to try to sleep over my head. He still tries to do that to this day. He doesn’t realize just how big he is. We always joke that he thinks of himself as a human. He can get really naughty especially
        at night. He has a tendency to get into everything and makes as much noise as he can. </p>

        <figcaption>We call her Skiddy, because she skids everywhere.</figcaption>

      <h3 id="skiddy">Skiddy</h3>

      <p> We have had Skiddy almost as long. She is primarily Adam’s cat. She doesn’t really listen to me too well. She loves Adam so much that she is known for grooming his hair. It’s so funny, Adam will be sitting on the couch and there is Skiddy
        licking
        his hair. We got her from a shelter. They found her on the streets of Minneapolis I guess. They picked her name, which is quite fitting, because whenever she runs anywhere she has a tendency to skid across the floors. It’s so funny to watch.
        She is our most timid cat we have. She has gotten much better over the years. When we first got her, she would go and hide under our bed. Now, she comes out and socializes. Lol, as much as cats can socialize. She’s so light and fluffy. She is
        a black long-haired cat as you can see in her picture. </p>

      <h3 id="percy">Percy</h3>

      <p> Our newest addition to our family is Perseus, Percy for short. I found Percy at my church in the parking lot. I’m still not sure if he was a tom cat or if he was just dropped there by someone. When I found Percy, he was very frightened. It
        was
        at about 10 o’clock at night. He actually initially scared me because I wasn’t quite sure if he was nice or not. He followed me around the parking lot until I got back into my car. I felt guilty leaving him there overnight and I was due to go
        back the next day to do my volunteer work, so I figured if he was still there I would call my husband and have him pick him up for me, and bring him back out our apartment we were living in at the time. </p>

      <p> The next day I returned to church Percy was still there. More frightened than ever, so I called my husband and he grabbed out pet carrier and brought Percy home. We eventually found out that he doesn’t like other animals because he tried to
        viciously
        attack poor Cyrus. It was one of the scariest things I think that I have ever seen. Not going to go into the details of the fight because it was horribly bad. There were times that I was contemplating if I should get rid of him, but we have
        come up with an alternative. We now have a special room for Percy upstairs and the other two are put downstairs. We take turns with who gets to be out with us. If they are upstairs he is in his room, or vice versa. </p>

      <p> We love our fur babies. We don’t have children of our own, so they are like our children to us. </p>
